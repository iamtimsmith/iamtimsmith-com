Kelsey Zwicker needed redesign that gave her site a more modern look. She wanted it to be fast since her original site took a while to load. I decided the best stack to use for this would a <a href="https://www.wordpress.org" target="_blank">WordPress</a> back-end so she would have a great content editing experience and <a href='https://www.gatsbyjs.org' target='_blank'>Gatsby.js</a> to create a very fast front-end.
