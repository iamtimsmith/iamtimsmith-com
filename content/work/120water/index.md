120Water is a website build which I led as a member of the team at [Design On Tap](https://www.designontap.com). It is a redesign of their old site and used WordPress as a CMS various tooling to build the theme such as Gulp, SCSS, jQuery, and Babel. They also have a shop on the site, so we had to integrate their Shopify store into the website to provide an easy cart experience for the customer.
