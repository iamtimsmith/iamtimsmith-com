I was hired as a freelancer by [Design On Tap](https://www.designontap.com) to help take care of some lingering bugs in the website. We used WordPress as a content management system since it was familiar to the client. The theme used Angular to create an admin interface for website sections. The front-end used jquery, scss, and php for templating.
