WP Trigger Netlify Build is a plugin I built to make it easier to use WordPress as a headless CMS. Setting up a static site with a [WordPress](https://www.wordpress.org) back-end requires a [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) rebuild whenever content is updated. Simply adding the data provided by Netlify removes the headache from making the stack work.
