Have you ever tried using a website while blindfolded? For many people, it would be near impossible to do, even with the most accessible of websites. There are people who use the web every single day with a variety of disabilities which can impact their user experience, yet too few frontend developers concern themselves with such experiences.

In some cases, I believe this lack of concern stems from a lack of knowledge on coding for accessible experiences. In other cases, developers may not even be aware of their users with disabilities or know that those users may be struggling to use the website. In my opinion, the worst offenders are the developers who cut accesibility from their code because it isn't seen as a _sexy new feature_, although I'm sure there are many users who would disagree.

In this article, I will discuss some of the specific users to keep in mind when designing and building an accessible website. In addition, I will demonstrate ways in which a poorly designed UI or UX can lead to difficulty when using the web.

## How do we use the web?

### Using three senses while on a website

### What if one of those three senses are missing?

## Disabilities which affect user experience

### Vision

### Hearing

### Motor

### Cognitive
